# 🛡️ Basic Network Sniffer (Python + Tkinter + Scapy)

A simple yet powerful GUI-based network sniffer that captures and displays live network traffic using Python's `scapy` and `tkinter`. Ideal for learning how data flows through a network, packet structure, and protocol analysis.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Real-time packet sniffing  
- 🎛️ Interactive GUI with Start, Stop, and Clear controls  
- 🧾 Displays:
  - Source and Destination IPs  
  - Protocol type (TCP, UDP, ICMP)  
  - First 64 bytes of the payload  
- 🖥️ Dark mode UI for better readability  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Tkinter (GUI)  
- Scapy (packet capture and analysis)  
- Threading
